# Hello, dear netizen! 🖖

My name is David (aka *Dave*), I'm currently working as a front-end web developer in this big world. Day by day I strive to learn more and apply it to the projects in which I am present, always looking for that special connection with the end user, making their experience easier and friendlier.

Let's work together! 🔥
